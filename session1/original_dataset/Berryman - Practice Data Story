Shelter dogs hope to mark their terrority at forever home


Matilda, Dory and Munchkin as well as nearly 15 other dogs are for sale at the Kentucky Humane Society’s main campus shelter. 

The dogs vary in age, gender and breed. But regardless, they are likely to be man’s best friend. 

The majority of dogs up for adoption are terriers, which the American Kennel Club describes as “feisty and energetic.” At this shelter, located at 241 Steedly Drive, hounds, retrievers and shepherds are also looking for homes.

More than half of the furry friends are male, like 2-month old puppy, New York Strip. And all the adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered. 

Over 80% of the dogs are five years old or younger, including eight which are a year or younger.

The dogs range in price with the younger dogs pricier than the older ones. The average price is about $220, but prices fluctuate between $100 for eight-year-old Alvin and $350 for a few puppies. 

If looking for a family dog, the American Kennel Club recommends adopting a retriever. These dogs, two of which are up for adoption at KHS’s main campus, are described as friendly and good with children. But they shed a substantial amount of their coat, especially in the spring and fall. 

The public can browse the adoptable dogs at the KHS’s website or meet these furry friends at the main campus on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. or weekends from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with masks recommended.
